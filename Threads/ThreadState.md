#### Lifecycle and States of a Thread in Java
A thread in Java at any point of time exists in any one of the following states. A thread lies only in one of the shown states at any instant:

New State
Runnable State
Blocked State
Waiting State
Timed Waiting State
Terminated State

States of Thread in its Lifecycle

Life Cycle of a Thread 
There are multiple states of the thread in a lifecycle as mentioned below:

1. New Thread: When a new thread is created, it is in the new state. The thread has not yet started to run when the thread is in this state. When a thread lies in the new state, its code is yet to be run and hasnâ€™t started to execute.
2. Runnable State: A thread that is ready to run is moved to a runnable state. In this state, a thread might actually be running or it might be ready to run at any instant of time. It is the responsibility of the thread scheduler to give the thread, time to run. 
A multi-threaded program allocates a fixed amount of time to each individual thread. Each and every thread runs for a short while and then pauses and relinquishes the CPU to another thread so that other threads can get a chance to run. When this happens, all such threads that are ready to run, waiting for the CPU and the currently running thread lie in a runnable state.
3. Blocked: The thread will be in blocked state when it is trying to acquire a lock but currently the lock is acquired by the other thread. The thread will move from the blocked state to runnable state when it acquires the lock.
4. Waiting state: The thread will be in waiting state when it calls wait() method or join() method. It will move to the runnable state when other thread will notify or that thread will be terminated.
5. Timed Waiting: A thread lies in a timed waiting state when it calls a method with a time-out parameter. A thread lies in this state until the timeout is completed or until a notification is received. For example, when a thread calls sleep or a conditional wait, it is moved to a timed waiting state.
6. Terminated State: A thread terminates because of either of the following reasons: 
Because it exits normally. This happens when the code of the thread has been entirely executed by the program.
Because there occurred some unusual erroneous event, like a segmentation fault or an unhandled exception.
