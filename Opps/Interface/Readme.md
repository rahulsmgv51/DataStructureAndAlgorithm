### Java Interface
1. An interface is a fully abstract class.It includes a group of abstract methods(methods without a body).
2. We use the interface keyword to create an interface in java.
3. Like abstract classes, we cannot create objects of interface.
4. To use an interface, other classes must implement it. We use the implements keyword to implement an interface.
