### Java Interface
1. An interface is a fully abstract class.It includes a group of abstract methods(methods without a body).
2. We use the interface keyword to create an interface in java.
3. Like abstract classes, we cannot create objects of interface.
4. To use an interface, other classes must implement it. We use the implements keyword to implement an interface.
5. We cannot extends multiple abtract class.
6. In Interface methods are by default abstract.


#### Advatages of java Interfaces
1. Similar to abstract classes, interfaces help us to acheive abstraction in java.
2. Interfaces are also used to acheive multiple inheritance in java.
3. All the methods inside an interface are implicitly public and all fields are implicitly public static final.
