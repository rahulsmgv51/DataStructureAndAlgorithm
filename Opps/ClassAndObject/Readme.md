Why create class ?
Need to store all type of data in a sigle place so that's why we create class.
If we use single data type then store only one datatyoe value but when we create class then store multiple type value.

class is description of an  object's property and behaviour.
Object is a real world entity
Object is an instance of a class
Object consumes memory to hold property values.
