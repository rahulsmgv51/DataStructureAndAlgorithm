### Java Abstract Class

1. The abstract class in java cannot be instantiated(we can not create objects of abstract classes). We use the abstract keyword to declare an abstract class.

2. An abstract class can have both the regular methods and abstrct methods.
3. A method that doesn't have its body is known as an abstract method.
4. Though abstract classes cannot be instantiated, we can create subclasses from it. We can then access members of the abstract class using the object of the subclass.
5. If the abstract class includes any abstract method, then all the child classes inherited from the abstract superclass must provide the implementation of the abstract method.


### Abstraction
1. Abstraction is an important concept of object-oriented programming that allows us to hide unnecessary details and only show the needed infromation.
this allows us to manage complexity by omitting or hiding details with a simpler higher-level idea.
