### Time Complexity
1. BigO Notation  -->> uparbound (Wrost Case)
2. Omega Notation -->> lowerbound (Best case)

#### Time Constraints and Time Complexity
Let n be the main variable in the problem.
1. If n <= 12, the time complexity can be O(n!).
2. If n <= 25, the time complexity can be O(2^n).
3. If n <= 100, the time complexity can be O(n^4).
4. If n <= 500, the time complexity can be O(n^3).
5. If n <= 10^4, the time complexity can be O(n^2).
6. If n <= 10^6, the time complexity can be O(n log n).
7. If n <= 10^8, the time complexity can be O(n).
8. If n <= 10^8, the time complexity can be O(log n) or O(1).


### Space Complexity 
The space complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and 
The space complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input.
