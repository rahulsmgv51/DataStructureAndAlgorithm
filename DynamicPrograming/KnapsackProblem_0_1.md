We are given n items. We are given an array that tells us about the price of those items and we are also given an array that tells us about the weight of those items. 
2 units weight of the 0th item costs 15 units of money. Similarly, 5 units weight of 1st costs 14 units money and so on. We have a bag and we know the capacity of the bag (we will be given the capacity of the bag). We have to make the price of this bag maximum. For instance, in the above example, we can have only 7 units weight of the items as the capacity of the bag is 7. The maximum price of the bag will be 75. How? Think about this!!!!!! You may refer to the 0-1 KNAPSACK PROBLEM video to understand the problem. Note that it is the 0-1 knapsack problem. Every item can either be selected completely or can be dropped. But we cannot break the item and select it. What do we mean by this? We mean that if we have an item whose price for 2 units weight is 20, then either we can include the complete 2 units weight of the object or we can drop the object (i.e. not select it). But we cannot select 1 or 1.5 units weight of that object. Also, we cannot select a single item multiple times. We can select one item completely and only once.
